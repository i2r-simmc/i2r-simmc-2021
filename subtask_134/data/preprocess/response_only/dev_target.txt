There's a jacket in that color hanging behind the pink and white striped shirt on those shelves against the wall.
Certainly! I will add that black jacket to your cart right now.
Sadly, there is not a single sleeveless black jacket in that size.
The short-sleeved purple and white top straight ahead comes in that size, as do the two black blouses one cubby to the left. Any interest in those?
Okay! I will put another black jacket in your cart.
I advise you to consider the white and grey short-sleeved blouse on this rack up front, the black blouse to the back of that same rack, and the black and white tank top hanging on the end of the top row against the wall in the back right.
See if you like that black blouse on the left behind the argyle shirt, the purple tank top at the far end of the bottom row in the back left, or the long-sleeved blouse with the bright colors in the row above that.
Which pants precisely?
Both of those are extra smalls, and that is the only size currently in stock for them.
Sorry i can't find anything like that?
Take a look at this black blouse at the left of the display and the white and black blouse on the right of the display.
The black blouse is from Art News Today and the white and black one is from Downtown Consignment.
Sure I'll add both blouses.
Sure thing.
How about the grey ones at the bottom of the shelf?
Which blouses are you referring to?
What do you think of this one on the right side of the third cubicle?

We've got these two on the front left of the carousel and one in the closest cubicle in the center row on the right.
The one on the carousel has a 4.7 rating, the other one a 3.1.
Sorry, which one?
I have this brown hoodie on the right wall, in the third cubby from the right. What do you think of that?
I'm afraid not at the moment. Could I help you with something else?
Ok, in addition to that brown hoodie, I do also have this green hoodie on the left side of the front floor rack.
Of course! The brown hoodie comes in S, XL, and XXL and has a 4.0 rating, while the green hoodie comes in S through L and has a rating of just 2.8.
Sure thing, I'll do so now!
Sure, how about these other dark blue jeans on the right wall here?
Which item are you referring to?
Are you a fan of either of the two colorful ones to the far right or the other colorful one on the left end of that same set of shelves?
Could you be more precise about which items you are seeking information on?
The blouse on the far right is a small, while the blouse on the far left is a medium.
You got it! I will put those long-sleeved blouses in your cart right now.
I apologize, but I do not see a single red and white blouse by that brand.

The dark pair on the right is available in extra extra large. Can you see yourself wearing those?
Okay! Those items will be added to your cart shortly.
There is a shirt with the same pattern in the front of that circular rack in the back of the store.
That is the only option I could find. Is there something else you'd like me to assist with?
There's a great solid green hoodie on the rack right up front and center and a great brown option hanging on the shelves to the right over the pair of blue jeans.
I'm not sure which shirt you're referring to. Can you please describe it in more depth?
That white and grey blouse is offered in extra small, small, medium, and extra large.
Will do!
Unfortunately, that's all I've got for hoodies.
Certainly! I'll get that taken care of.
See if any of those dresses hanging against the wall on the bottom row catch your eye.
I see a lovely brown coat hanging up front on the right.
I'll put those pieces in your cart right away.
Those dresses are both relatively expensive, actually. There's also a very chique pink dress on the rack to the left that you may wish to look at.
I have three blouses that may fit your needs. The first one is the black and white blouse in front of us, then the light grey one in the next compartment, and the black one in the third compartment from the left.

The brown one fits that description best.
Are you liking the look of that solid green one on the rack up front or the brown one hanging above the pair of light-wash blue jeans up front on the right?
Did you like the brown or green options I showed you?
I'm afraid there are no hoodies in that size. Is there something else I can help you with?
Which item would you like to know the price of?
That hoodie costs $144.99.
You got it! I'll get those pants added to your cart.
