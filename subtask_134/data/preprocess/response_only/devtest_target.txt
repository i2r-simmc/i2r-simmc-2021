Sorry, I don't have anything like that.
Which one do you mean?
It's a S from Global Voyager.
How about the gray and brown one or the violet one?
Here's a blue pair you might want to check out.
Check out the black jacket hanging up on the top right against the wall and the brown one hanging up on the bottom left.
Unfortunately, nothing came up as a match for that.
No, I couldn't find any sweaters in grey or brown that were by River Chateau.
What do you think of the purple one hanging up against the wall, the center one on the bottom row, the violet one on the table, just to the left of the pink shirt, and the red one that's on the same row, the second one from the left.
I'm confirming that order and adding them to your cart.
I've got several options. What do you think of the white, red, and violet one in the third upper compartment, the white, red, and violet one in the compartment just to the left of that, and the green, violet, and pink one hanging on the rack in the bottom right?
Take a look at the dark blue jeans in the fourth bottom compartment and the dark blue ones just to the left of that.
Yes, I'm doing that now for you.
I'm sorry, but no jeans are available in size XXL.
I've got the pink one in the second cabinet from the door, the black one in the fifth cabinet, and the pink one at the left side of the table.
That pink one itself, the other pink one, and the black one you already saw.
On the closer round rack, I have the black one at the front left, the black and white one at the front right, and the red and yellow one in the cabinet closest to the door.
I don't believe I do.  Can I help you with anything else?
Those two shirts both have a good rating.
The dark blue pair second from the door have a good rating.
No, I don't have anything like that.  Could I help you find something else?
On the closer round rack, I have that green hoodie at the left.
I don't happen to have anything like that.
Sure thing.
The beige one has a 4.3 and comes in L, M, XXL, S, XL.  The purple one has a 3.4 and comes in M, XXL, XS, L.
I'll update your cart.
I've got the dark blue pair in the middle cabinet, and another dark blue pair in the right cabinet.
I've got the gray and white one in the left cabinet, the brown one at the left of the middle cabinet, and another brown one next to it.
How about these two black coats?
Which coats are you referring to?
They are both rated 4.5 and cost 109.99.
Sorry I can't find a match.
Those two black coats are the best matches.
Sure I'll add that black coat to your cart?
How about this green sweater, this red and black one, or this pink one?
Have a look at the folded one on the right on the table or the one up top in the third cubby from the end.
Both are pink, the folded one is from Coats & More and the other is from Uptown Gallery.
Ok, I'll add those both to your cart.
The one you're getting is the best option I see.
There's a nice green one on the left of the hanging rack in the front.
There's two options here, a brown one and a purple one hanging in the front.
Sorry, I can't find any like that.
What do you think of the two pairs of dark blue jeans on the left?
No problem, I've placed both in your cart.
They are both 184.99.
Which coat do you mean?
It has a 4.1 rating and it's from Downtown Stylists.
Of course. I'll add that now.
I have a white and grey blouse on the shelf to the left, as well as a white, black, and red blouse and a black and white, both hanging on the rack to the right.
Which jeans do you mean?
Both pairs of jeans are XS. The dark blue jeans are from Modern Arts and the blue and black are from Ocean Wears.
The blue and black jeans are XS display trousers from Ocean Wears which cost 244.99. They have a rating of 4.6 and a denim pattern. They are available in XXL and XS. The dark blue jeans are also XS display trousers but are from Modern Arts. They cost 184.99. They have a 4.7 rating and a denim pattern. They come in XL, S, XS, XXL, and M.
I think the following three jackets are in your style: the light grey one on the floor hanger by the entrance, the black one near it, and another black one on the floor hanger in the middle of the room. Do you like any of them?
I can suggest the light grey jacket on that rack,  the brown one  in the first cupboard from the right, in the second compartment from the right, and, of course, the black jacket on the rack by the entrance itself.
The black jacket from Yogi Fit costs 174.99. The light grey one, from 212Local, has a lower price, 44.99.

Of course! You will see them in your cart in a second.
May I offer you the black sweater on the left  and another black one on the left side  of the floor rack closer to us?
Of course! Both pairs are from Modern Arts  and shown in size XS.
I have two jackets that fit these requirements, the light grey one on the left of the wall rack and the brown one on the same rack but  on the right in the bottom row. What do you think?
Unfortunately, I have no plain-color  jackets  in your preferred price range that have favorable reviews.
I found a black dress that fits that description on the left wall.
Sorry, I don't see anything like that. Would you like to continue shopping?
The grey and white StyleNow Feed blouse is rated at 2.9 with a leafy pattern and long sleeves. It is priced at 54.99 and shown in S, but available in XS, S, M, XL. The black Modern Arts blouse  is rated 4.9 with long sleeves and priced at 54.99. It is shown in XXL, but available in M, L, XL, and XXL.
I will add those two blouses to your cart.
Which item are you referring to?
That blouse is shown in size S
How about the purple shirt on the wall in back?
Aside from those two options, I can recommend the red, white and violet blouse on the left wall
I suggest looking at the light grey coat on the left wall, the brown coat underneath on the same wall, or the brown coat on the circular rack to the left.
The white and grey one is available in XS, S, M, XL and the black one is in M, L, XL, XXL.
Would you consider the long-sleeve black one hanging to the left, the black one on the shelves next to the pink sweater, or the long-sleeve grey and white blouse one shelf to the right?
The jeans on the very end are made by Modern Arts. The lighter pair is made by Yogi Fit.
Okay! I will put both of those jeans in your cart.
Sadly, there do not seem to be any options by that brand. What else can I do for you today?
Unfortunately, I do not have any more suggestions as far as blouses are concerned.
Can I get your opinion on that solid brown jacket hanging above the pair of light-wash jeans?
The darker pair is an extra small. It is also in stock in small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large. The lighter pair is a medium and is also in stock in extra small, large, extra large, and extra extra large.
I think you'll find the three black dresses in the two inner shelves all surpass your expectations.

We have this grey pair at the bottom of the shelf display.
Sure I can add both blouses.

Would you mind identifying more precisely which pair of jeans have caught your eye?
Those jeans are offered in extra small, small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large. They have been awarded an impressive rating of 4.7.
There is a grey shirt folded up on the table to the right in between a red sweater and a grey and white striped shirt. See if that one works for you.
That brand also makes the pair to the right of them.
Yes. There are no other Modern Arts jeans, sorry.
This first brown one on the left might interest you.
Here's this light grey coat at the top left of the wall hanger display, the brown coat on the bottom right of the wall hanger display, and the brown coat on the circular hanger display.
Which brown coat are you referring to?

Sure, I will add those to the cart.
Sorry, it doesn't look like we have anything like that. Is there something else I can help you find?
Sure, I'll add that to your cart.
What do you think about these?
Which one do you mean?

Here are expensive sofa chairs I found.
What about this brown one?
How about either of those gray ones or the white one?
Sorry, I don't have anything else.

Would you consider that table in the back to the right? It's neutral brown color would blend well with anything!
I'm afraid that's the only table here.
Actually, that table in the back is made by Modern Arts!
Alright, I'll add the table to your cart for your convenience.
Would you be interested in a white chair?
Which brown table do you mean?
That table by Modern Arts has customer rating of 3.5.
We don't carry any other Modern Arts wooden chairs,  unfortunately.
Sure, first off there's a grey chair way at the back on the white and grey rug.  Next is another grey chair that's partially cut off at the right edge.  Lastly, we have the white chair at the bottom left.
Sorry, which two do you mean?  I presented three.
They both will set you back $349.
They're again the same, being made by Downtown Stylists.
What do you think of the white one on the left?

I will add these to your cart right away.
I suggest the two you have chosen.
Sorry, I couldn't find chairs specifically with good ratings.
What do you think of the table in the very back to the right?
I couldn't find anything else matching that.
The table in the back?
It is from Modern Arts and is wooden.
What do you think about the white chair in the back?
What do you think about the shelf in the back? The one against the divide.

Unfortunately, those are the only ones available. Can I help you with something else?
Sure thing, I'll add them to your cart right away!
No, I'm afraid we don't have anything with that description. Is there something else I can help with?
Here are three, the first and third on the left and the one on the right.
What do you think of these all the way in  the back?
I'm sorry, I have no search results for those criteria.
I'm sorry, no matches on that search either.
I have the gray chair at the corner of the white striped rug, the other gray one in the front right, and the white one with the pillow at the front left.
The black one is $399 from StyleNow Feed, the white one is $549 from North Lodge.
My apologies, but I don't have any brown padded chairs by 212 Local.
I'm happy to help, sure thing.
Those wooden ones in the back on the dark multicolored rug are made by that brand!
I'm sorry, but I don't have any similar items with higher ratings to offer you today.
Those wooden shelves on the dark rug are still the only option.
Great! I'll stick that in your cart for your convenience.
What do you think of the wood shelves in the back? They match your criteria.
Sorry, I could not find anything that matched your description.
Okay, I will add them to your cart.
No, I could not find anything that matched your criteria.
Of course! For sofa chairs, we have the grey one in the middle there across from the red sofa, another grey one closer to the front to the right and a white one in front of that to the left. Do any of those suit your preferences?
I'm sorry, which one did you want to know that for?
Yes, the one in the back has a customer rating of 4.8, while the one closer to right has a rating of 4.8.
Unfortunately, the only ones we have in that style is that one and the one across from the red sofa.
Have you seen this one yet?
No problem, I'll put that in your basket.
Here's a few for you to check out.
I will certainly do that! Let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
Of course, how do you like the grey one in the back, the grey one closer to the front or the white one in the very front?
I'm sorry, those are the only lamps we have that are of that price.
No, I'm sorry. We don't have any other lamps priced at $549.
Great! I will add both of those to your cart now.
What do you think of the one against the wall back there?

What do you think of the brown one in the corner?

Sorry, I cannot find anything similar. What else do you need help with?
ERROR
Okay, I will also add that.
Sorry, I cannot find anything that matches your criteria. What else can I do to be of assistance?
Take a look at the white rug in the middle of the room and tell me what you think.
Okay, it will be added.
You got it. Another will be added to your cart.
Cool! Let's start with that white chair in the back. What are your thoughts?
Both of those pieces are made with leather.
You got it! I'll put those items in your cart for you.
The white lamp at the edge of the grey rug is more expensive.
Here's a white one.
I only have the one expensive option to show you.
Sorry, I don't have anything else.
Which rug?
There are several grey sofa chairs you might like, along with a white sofa chair. Take a look at what I found.
Okay, they will be added to your cart.
Sorry, no other items match your description aside from the already mentioned ones.
Take a look at the brown table in the back. What do you think of it?
Sure, what about this white area rug in the center?
Of course, I'll do so right away.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything matching that description. Can I help with something else?
Sure thing, I'll add those to your cart as well.
Do you like this white one I found?
No problem, I'll add that now.
The white rug is by that brand.
No problem, I'm adding that rug to your cart.
The white one in the middle is.
The first one is the brand River Chateau. The one in the back is Global Voyager.
I suggest checking out the brown table next to the shelves.
Sure thing. I'll add it.
How do you like this white one? It is made by Uptown Studio and has a good customer rating.
The one in the front is $549 and the other one is $349.
I will add those to your cart.
I will add those to your cart.
I can help with that. DO you like these wooden ones in the back?
Ok. I will add that now.
Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that. Can I help with something else?
Ok. I will add that one, too.
Take a look at the brown table in the last display in this room on the right.
I am sorry, I don't have any other highly-rated brown tables from Modern Arts.
I don't have any pieces with these characteristics today.
Certainly! I am adding this table to your cart  as we speak.
I can suggest three armchairs. First, the white one on our immediate left. Second, the grey one at the far end of the next display in front of us. Finally, the gray chair a little away from us on the right.
I am not sure which end tables you are looking at, could you rephrase?
Thank you! I have this information for you: the black end table  from North Lodge is rated 3.7;  the white end table from StyleNow Feed enjoys a much higher rating, 4.9.
Unfortunately, I can see no high-end armchairs.
What do you think of the brown one in the back with the decorative legs?
Which item are you asking about?
That retails for $499.
Sounds good.  I'll update your cart.
How about those wooden ones in the back against the right wall?
Sorry I don't have any wooden shelves.
Which one?
That one is rated 3.0.
There's that white one. What do you think?
Sorry, I can't find anything like that.
Which couch chair?
It's rated 4.2.
How is this white one in the middle of the room?
I don't have anything quite like that.
I do not have anything that meets all those parameters.
Sorry, I don't.
At the back right corner, I have those low wooden shelves that you might like.
Near the shelves you just saw, I've got that white chair that may work for you.
Great.  I'm adding it to your cart.
Sure thing.  I'll add that accent chair as well.
There's two grey ones on the floor, and a white one up here in the front. What do you think?
That one has a good rating. So does the grey one in the front.
How about the one along the back wall?
Okay. It's in your cart.
Take a look at the wooden shelf on the right.
Take a look at the white couch chair on the left.
No, sorry. What else can I search for you?
OK, I will add that to your cart.
Take a look at the blue jacket on the top row, second from the back, as well as the light grey one right beneath it.
Not that I could find, sorry! Anything else?
I couldn't find anything. Wanna search again?
The maroon one is by Garden Retail and is in L while the black one is in XL and by Downtown Consignment.
I was unable to find anything fitting that description.
How is this light grey one on the right on the bottom middle?
There is a grey and brown one on the left on the bottom section, and a blue and white shirt as well as a light grey one just in front of it.
Sorry I don't have any black shirts.
Which coats?
The black one is 109.99, and the light grey costs 179.99.
I have a blue and grey shirt on the lower right of the table, a blue and white shirt next to it, and a grey and brown shirt diagonal to that.
Both shirts are by Modern Arts. The light grey shirt has a 3.7 rating, but the grey and brown shirt has only a 2.8 rating.
I'm afraid the light grey shirt and the grey and brown shirt are the only ones currently available that fit your description.
Other than this light grey shirt, there's the blue and grey shirt and the blue and white one from earlier. What are your thoughts on those three?
Sure! I have a grey sweater on the bottom left and another grey sweater next to the light grey shirt.
I've got the blue jacket hanging in the top row, as well as the light gray one hanging in the bottom row.
That coat is the only one with that sleeve length.
The gray one has a 2.6, the blue one has a 2.8.
For which jacket?
It has a 2.6.
I can offer you the grey and black sweater on the tiered shelf on the left. It is on the bottom tier, in the back row on the left.
Unfortunately, I do not have jackets with these characteristics at the moment.
Great choices! I am updating your cart to include them right now.
I have several long-sleeve sweatshirts in medium on that tiered shelf.  How do you like the purple one on the middle tier, the maroon one in the back row on the bottom tier, and the grey one in the front row on that tier?
I would also consider the grey sweatshirt on the left on the bottom tier.
What do you think of this brown, white shirt on the floor rack, the the black one on the same rack? They both have half sleeves.
Take a look at this brown one on the back floor rack.
I couldn't find anything like that unfortunately. Could I help with something else?
Sorry, nothing that matches your criteria.
Sure, I added it to the cart for you.
Do you like this black t-shirt in the back?
This black one in the back and the brown and white one next to it are what I have available right now.
I'm sorry, I don't have any other t-shirts in extra large that have a good customer rating.
Yes. I will add that one now.
Do you like either of the two coats on that back rack?
Do you like this blue one on the rack against the back wall? It is an expensive jacket from Home Store.
The one on the back rack is available in extra small and large. The one on the table in the front is available only in extra small.
This one on the back is what I have like that.
Ok. I will add those items now.
Ok. Adding it now.
What do you think of the red and white jacket?
What do you think of the blue jacket? It matches your search criteria.
Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria.
The blue jacket is blue and the other is red and white.
There are blue jeans on the left closet which match your search criteria.
How about the grey and white one hanging up on the wall on the left, the grey and white one hanging on the bottom rack on the right, or the blue one hanging in the center of the right wall? They are all jackets.
Which one do you mean?
This one is by Downtown Consignment.
Ok. I will add those two items right now.
The blue jacket in the front on the bottom rack, the blue jacket in the center on the rack, and the blue jacket on the back left wall are the similar items I have to show you.
There's a blue-grey one on the back wall and a brown one on the right that you might like.
It's just that and the brown one.
What do you think of the light blue jeans? You might like the grey, as well.
The light blue are a M and are rated 4.9. The grey are a L and are rated 4.3.
The grey-blue and the brown both come in that size.
Sure, what do you think of the red and white jacket on the wall straight back?  If those colors clash too much for you, you might like the blue jacket hanging up in the middle of the right wall, or the black one to your immediate right.
Sure, could you clarify which jackets you're referring to?
The black jacket costs $174.99 and has a customer rating of 4.0.  The blue one costs $39.99 and has a customer rating of 4.8.
Sure thing, I've added it to your cart.
Sure, how do you like the blue jacket in the top right corner of the far wall?  The blue and light grey jackets hanging up on the bottom rack to your near right also match that description.
I do!  At the back left you can see a green hoodie hanging on the wall.  There's also a blue one hanging near the back along the right wall, straight above the light grey pants.
Unfortunately nothing I have matches those criteria.
Which item would you like to know that for?
Ok, the blue one only comes in S, but the green one comes in S, M and L.
That's it for hoodies right now.
How about this one?
Which one are you interested in?
The customer reviews are 4.2 and it is made by HairDo.
I couldn't find anything in size m.
Unfortunately, the only jeans available we have are these grey ones you are looking at.
I didn't find anything sorry.
Which ones?
The black one is 3.0 and the other is 3.8.
In the rack, there's a black coat and brown coat to the left, and a grey one to the front right.
Okay, doing that now.
Sure!  Over to the bottom right you can see a brown one on the circular rack.  At the back wall in the section to the left of the bright blue jacket you can see a couple more brown hoodies.
Yea, there's actually one more brown hoodie on the round rack at the front right.
Sorry, I don't have anything else like that right now.
Sure, they're actually both XXL and rated at 4.0.
Sure, the grey hat is now in your cart.
I do, there's a black coat and two grey ones on the rack at the front right, all of which come in XXL.
Sure, up at the top left of the shelving unit is a grey coat, with a black one to the right of that.
Well there's another brown hoodie to the left of the other one, and there's another brown hoodie right at the bottom right up front.
Which brown hoodies? There are several.
Sure, both of those are available in S, XL and XXL and have matching 4.0 ratings.

The two other blue jeans might interest you.
Got it. Adding both of those hats now.
Which hat?
It is $19.99 and comes in all sizes.
Sure, on the counter in front of you there's a blue and green one at the far end, with a grey one just in front of it.  There's also a grey and white jacket on the right just underneath the red and white shoe boxes.
Of course you can, it'll be added to your cart right away.
Which grey jacket do you mean?
It's a size M.
The grey one on the counter is from that company.
How about this green hoodie?
The blue jacket is available in all sizes except for xs and it if from Global Voyager. The other one comes in s, xl and xxl and it is made by 212 Local.
I don't have anything that would match your criteria. Is there anything else I could help you with today?

Here is one more I found for you.
What do you think of the blue shirt and the blue and white shirt?
Sorry, nothing else matches your search criteria.
Which item are you talking about?
It is available in sizes M, L, and XXL.
Sorry, nothing matches your search criteria.
I have a yellow and brown one, or a dark yellow.
Ok, I added them to your shopping cart.
The dark yellow one is from Brain Puzzles, and the yellow/brown one is from Garden Retail.  Both have full sleeves.
I have that one hanging in the back left.
I don't have anything like that, sorry.
What do you think of the yellow, brown sweater in the back rack on the left or the dark yellow sweater on the back right rack?
The two yellow ones I recommended are the best suggestions I can make.
Sorry, but it doesn't look like we have anything like that. Is there anything else I can get for you?
Sorry, but there aren't any bicolored sweaters in XXL.
OK, I will add both to your cart.
I've got several for you to check out. There's a grey one on the left, the fourth one in on the bottom row. The fifth coat on that row is a brown one. I also have a black on the right center rack, about halfway in.
The only other option like that is the sixth coat on the left bottom row. It's also grey.
No, I'm sorry, that's all. Can I help you in any other way?
Let's see what we have. I've got a yellow and brown sweater in the back center of the room. Right next to it is a dark yellow one.
Consider it done. I'm adding it to your cart.
Let's try these. The second from last item on the top left row is a purple tshirt. I also have a white tshirt on the extreme right side.
Yes, indeed. I'm adding it to your cart right now.
Nothing came up for a half sleeve in size M with good customer reviews.
No, all I have is the white tee.
Here's the difference. The first one is made by Downtown Stylists and the second is by Cats Are Great.
I could recommend this dark red one hanging on the right wall. It's a nice, plain shirt.
Unfortunately, I don't see anything else that matches what you're looking for.
Which dresses do you mean?
The violet one is a HairDo dress, and the purple one is from Modern Arts.
