What do you think of the brown jacket?
Happy to help! I have identified several shirts on this table that are highly likely to be pleasing to you. Let's begin with the olive shirt with the white stripes at the far end of the bottom row. Then, in the top row, there are two greyish shirts right next to each other.
The one that is closest to you is a plain grey shirt by the brand Garden Retail, while the one next to it is actually grey with brown vertical stripes, and the brand that makes that one is Cats Are Great. The first grey shirt is rated more highly, with a near-perfect score of 4.9 in comparison to the striped grey shirt's average rating of 3.8. Both shirts have long sleeves. The striped grey shirt is cheaper than the solid grey option. It can be yours today for just $29.99, while the solid grey shirt costs $84.99. Finally, the first grey shirt is an extra large and is also available in extra small, small, large, and extra large. The striped grey shirt is a medium and is offered in the full range of sizes from extra small to extra extra large.
It's your lucky day! There's a white vest by that brand hanging in the middle of the bottom row against the wall. Is it perfect for you?
The yellow shirt's ratings are fairly high, actually!
The blue shirt is a bit more expensive, at $84.99. The yellow shirt costs $79.99. It is made by Pedals & Gears, while the blue shirt is made by The Vegan Baker.
Does that solid blue one hanging over the black pants on the right meet your expectations? There is also a nice solid brown hoodie hanging over the blue jeans on the set of shelves to the left. How does that one look?
I'm so sorry, but there are no affordable hoodies by that brand over here.
Of course! We have a white and black one above the grey pants. What are your thoughts?
I'm sorry, could you specify more which ones you are referring to?
Ok, the grey and white one is a size L and the white and black one is a size S.
Unfortunately, we don't have anything like these in that size.
We have a couple, yes! How do you like the ones under the grey pants or the other ones under the grey joggers?
Yes, I will add both items to your cart now.
We have a couple of yellow ones folded on the table. Do either of those interest you?
Unfortunately, we don't have any sweaters in that color and size.
We have the light blue one on the table. What do you think?
I'm sorry, which one did you mean?
I just might! That bright blue jacket is made by Home Store.
I think the green sweater on the table and the red and purple sweaters in the bottom row would all be fantastic additions to your wardrobe.
You got it! I'll put that jacket in your cart right away.
Could you clarify for me which item you are inquiring about?
That brown jacket boasts a strong rating of 4.4, and the one represented here is a small.
I'm glad you like them! I'll get those sweaters in your cart right away.
I have identified the two blue jeans on either end of this first set of shelves as options you will probably like.
Okay! I will put that jacket and that coat in your cart for you.

There's two in the cubby on the far right, a black one and a red white and yellow one. There's also another red, white, and  yellow one in the middle of the top row on the back wall.
Sure! The beige one is a M and the purple one is a L.
I have one folded on the table, the grey one second to last on the left in the back row. It is in your size. Do you like it?
Consider it done! In a second, you'll see it in your cart.
I am sorry, which sweater are you interested in?
Thanks! That sweater is on display in S.
I have no tshirts  in XXL, sorry about that.
Unfortunately, my search for tshirts in XXL brings no results.
I have three dresses like that, all on the floor hanger on the left: the beige one closest to us, the black and olive one facing the wall on the right, and the maroon one facing the wall on the left.
How do you feel about the black blouse on the wall to the right or the black blouse hanging on the center ract?
The green pants are available in XL and the brown pants in XS.
The other black blouse is by Art News Today.
I found a black sweater on the right you may like.
The maroon, white and blue one is by Ocean Wears and shown in size XS. The black one is by Modern Arts and shown in XXL.
I see a grey coat above the black blue jeans, a brown coat above the brown pants, and a black coat next to that one.
Which item do you mean?
I have these two in the bottom left display case. Do you like either one?
They are both from Downtown Consignments and they both come in  sizes XXL, XS, M, S,  XL, and L.
I'm sorry, these are the only two pair we have.
I'm sorry, I don't see anything else.
Sorry, which one?
Oh, it comes in XS, M, and L.
I have these three on the floor rack, have a look.
How about the two dark blue pants to the left?
Which ones?
Yeah, both are from Pedals & Gears.
Those are the only two that are like that.
Actually, both are available in XS, S, L, and XXL.
Perhaps you would like the black coat above the second pair of dark blue pants?
Well, you might like the pink sweater and the red one to the left of it on the table to the left.
Here's a gray one, a violet one, and a second gray one.
Check out the brown shirt, the gray one, and the blue and white one.
Just the violet one and the blue and gray one.

I'll add those to your cart.
I have a green one, pink one, and yellow and black one.

It doesn't look like it.  Anything else you'd like to see?
I've got the black one on the bottom left of the wall, the black one in the third cabinet, and the gray one on the round rack closest to the cabinets.
Which one do you mean?
That one costs 199.99.
That dress has a good rating.
I'll update your cart.
I've got the dark blue pair in the right cabinet from that brand.
I think you'd do well to consider the light-wash pair on the right and the darker pair to the left of them.
Those two brown jackets hanging up straight to the back have great ratings! You may also want to check out the grey and white option hanging over the light-wash jeans on the right.
The brown jacket on the left is relatively inexpensive, actually, and medium is in stock for that one.
Sorry, which article of clothing would you like to know the size of?
That jacket is a small.
I apologize, but there are no inexpensive short-sleeved jackets in medium available.
I think you'd be crazy about that pink and white striped shirt hanging up against the wall, the violet shirt folded up on the table next to the red one, and the other pink and white striped shirt on the table.
I have this in  the third cubicle straight ahead, what do you think?
I'm sorry, I don't see anything else.
No, I don't see anything else like that.
I have the last three in the second cubicle in the center row, have a look.
I'll put that in your cart.
Nothing came back on a search for that.
The first one in that cubicle is a match.
What do yo think of the grey coat on the left or the black on the rack?
The grey is XS and the black XL.
Which items do you mean?
The grey goes for 59.99 and comes in L, XS, and XXL. The black costs 179.99 and is only available in XL.
Nothing that matches your search terms.
No problem, both items have been placed in your cart.
What do you think of the three pink sweaters across the top shelves?
I've got the brown one in the third-closest cabinet on the left.
I don't have any in that size from Garden Retail with a good rating.
I've got the gray one in the second closest cabinet on the left, the brown ones next to them, and the gray ones in the cabinet closest to the door on the right.
Which gray pair?

I apologize, but there are no matches that I can see. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
In fact, there is a white vest next to the blue hoodie towards the back that just went on sale!
Which black coat are you interested in?
That coat is made by Cats Are Great and has an incredible rating of 4.8.
Can I interest you in those dark green joggers against the wall to the left of the camo pants?
Sorry, I'm not sure which tops you are referring to. Could you give me a few more details?
Both of those blouses sell for $79.99.
The black and white tank top near it is more affordable, as is the red, white, and yellow long-sleeve blouse to the right of that and the grey and white short-sleeve blouse to the right of that one.
I'm sorry, there are no other affordable blouses in extra large.
I sure can! Those shoes will appear in your cart in just a moment.
How about that dark red one in the top row of that table in the back?
Indeed I do! Are you a fan of that violet tank top behind the short-sleeved white blouse, the first red, white, and yellow long-sleeved knit top to the left of that, or the dark grey option at the end of that compartment?
That green one to the far left would be quite versatile, as would the brown one one shelf over.
The green hoodie is smaller. It is a size small, while the brown hoodie is a size extra extra large. The brown hoodie is rated significantly higher, at 4.0 in comparison to the green hoodie's rating of 2.8.
Which items would you like to know the sizes of?

So true! I'll get those hoodies in your cart without delay.
There are two black dresses that might work! Does this black one hanging up front on the right pique your curiosity? Or how about the one on the shelves further back next to the red and white jacket?
Here is a black shirt I found for you.
I coulnd't find anything that would match your criteria. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Unfortunately, there are no highly rated inexpensive sleeveless dresses by that brand at this time.
I will move those pieces to your cart without delay.
You may want to consider some of the blouses on this circular rack to the left. There is a nice black and white striped option on the right-hand side, another black and white option near it, and a red, white, and yellow top a little ways behind it.
Do you care for camouflage-patterned clothing? All of the green pants on this first set of shelves would be great additions to any wardrobe.
Both of those pairs are extra larges, and they have both been rated a 3.9 by buyers.
How about the black dress on the left?
It doesn't look like we have that.
What do you think of the dark green joggers on the right?
Could you clarify which one you are referring to?

OK. I will add those to your cart.

Both have long sleeves. The white, black, and red is an XL and the red and white a L.
I don't have anything with that description. Can I show you something else?
No problem. That's in your cart.
I have a grey pair on the right, a blue in the middle, and another grey pair on the left. What do you think?
Sure thing, both items have been added to your cart.
I think that bright blue one on the left would be an excellent purchase, and you also can't go wrong with the grey jacket or the white jacket to the right of it hanging over the brown pants on the right.
Unfortunately, there are no other jackets available in that size.
I will gladly add those blue jeans to your cart.
Sorry, which items were you wanting to know that information for?

I have the first one in the second cubicle, the only one in the fifth cubicle, and the first one in the seventh cubicle.
Do you like the ones in the fourth cubicle?
Here's a gray pair and a black and white pair.
Which ones?
The gray ones are $64.99 from The Vegan Baker, and the others are $54.99 from Art Den.
Here are gray ones and brown ones.
Sorry, I don't have anything like that.
Sorry, nothing else.
Sorry, I don't have any sweaters by them.
Here's what I have for you. On the bottom right, you'll see a pair of light blue jeans hanging up and just to the left of those another pair of blue jeans.
What about the blue jacket on the top right? Or maybe the brown one that's in the second compartment from the left.
I'm sorry, but nothing was available that was similar. Could I help with something else?
No, there weren't any jackets in a leafy design in size S or available in size L.
How about the black one hanging up just to the left of the brown jacket?
Then let me direct your attention to the black coats hanging up in the top left compartment.
Yes, I can confirm that transaction.
What about this black coat on the far right of the shelf display and the black one on the left of the shelf display?
How about these light blue jeans on the bottom of the wall display?
Sure thing.
Which blouse are you referring to?
It costs 9.99 and is rated 2.9.
Sure thing.
What about the maroon sweater at the top of the table display, the red sweater below it, and the grey black sweater to the left of the table display?
Take a look at the brown pants next to the joggers or the brown pants next to the camo pants.
Take a look at the white vest above the brown pants.
In addition to the two you mentioned you could check out the blue black jeans on the end.
Which brown pants?
They are both River Chateau and rated at 3.4
Okay, I will add the hoodie to your cart.
You may like the brown jacket on the right rack, the light grey jacket on the left wall or the brown jacket on the wall in the back.
There are some excellent options on that table to the right. Can I get your thoughts on that light-colored shirt on the near end of the bottom row, the violet shirt further down in that same row, and the blue and grey shirt in the middle of the top row?
Sorry, which coat would you like to know more about?
That coat is made by North Lodge and has an excellent rating of 4.5.
Indeed I can! There is a highly rated red and white one above the light-wash blue jeans. You might also want to consider the black jacket hanging over the black pants to the right of that one and the grey jacket hanging on the wall to the far right.
I'm sorry to say I cannot find any options like that for you. Is there something else you'd like help with?
The brown pants are made by River Chateau, while the other pants are made by Pedals & Gears. The dark blue trousers are a bit cheaper, at $239.99. The brown pants cost $244.99.

I'm afraid I don't at the moment.

Sure! These black shoes will be in your cart shortly.
Those are already priced fairly high, as are the other black shoes on the left of the shelves to the right.
I apologize, but there do not seem to be any expensive shoes by that brand in large at this time.

Perhaps the bright blue jacket further back or the light grey jacket on that circular rack would suit your needs better.

I think you would be very stylish in that bright blue one in the middle of the top row or the grey and white or the red and white ones on the bottom row. Do you agree?
So sorry, but it does not look like there are any expensive jackets with vertical stripes in this store.
If you like that one, you might also be into the bright blue jacket on the row above it or the dark green and blue jacket in the table at the back of the store.
The blue jacket is cheaper. It costs $99.99, while the grey and white jacket is priced at $109.99.

No problem, both have been added.
Can I get your thoughts on this first pink one up front on the right?

Which shirt are you asking about?
That blouse comes in extra small and medium and has been rated a 3.4 on average.
I'm so sorry, but I can't find anything in that size. Is there something else you'd like to look for today?
Take a look at this purple one at the back of the front floor rack, this grey one on the center floor rack, and this beige one on the far back floor rack.

For you, I would suggest the gray sofa at the back of the brown rug, or the small square brown sofa at the front of that rug.
Unfortunately, I don't have any similar items in gray wool..
No, unfortunately, I don't have any brown wool sofas either.
Unfortunately, I don't have anything in metal either.  Is there anything else you'd like to see?

The brown chair to the right, behind the shelves, could work. What do you think?
Sorry, that's all I could find.
For sofas, I would recommend the grey one in the very back, a little to the left, or the small brown one at the front of the blue rug.
For the price point and color preference, the smaller brown sofa is the best option. I could not find anything else similar.
What do you think of the two brown coffee tables on the blue rug?

Certainly, I've added it to your cart.  Can I help you find anything else?
Sure thing, I've added two more end tables to your cart.

Would you please identify more precisely which table you would like more information about?

I see you're looking for a leather sofa chair. I can point you towards the white sofa chair in the back, the small white chair in the center and the white chair to your right.
The chair in the back and the white chair to your right have what you are looking for.
Which items are you referring to?
I see that the white chair to your left is by Downtown Consignment and has a customer rating of 4.2, while the white chair to your right is by Modern Arts and is rated 2.9.
Between the striped rugs, I have the white chair with the tufted detailing on the arms, the other white one to the right of it, and on the striped rug to the back, I have the low backless white chair as well.
The one with the arms is by Downtown Consignment and costs $349, and the backless one is $449 by Modern Arts.
For which chair?
No worries. Both chairs are made of leather.

Can you be more specific which you mean?
Both lamps sell for $549 and have the same 4.2 rating.

Any one of those couch chairs would be a good match.

Does the white couch chair atop the blue and white rug interest you? We also have a white couch chair just past the blue chair and another longer chair to the right of that.
The chair in the back is a Modern Arts leather chair, and the closer chair is a leather Downtown Consignments chair.
I can suggest the same chairs as before. They all have great ratings.
Both are from Modern Arts.
Tell me if you like the white chair located in the back, or these two white sofa chairs in the center of the display. They are all made of leather.

I don't right now unfortunately, is there another one of your preferred brands I could look for?
The brown wooden table in the back on the grey rug to the right would be a great match for your needs.

There are two hoodies on the left shelf in brown and blue, and another brown on the right rack. Do you like any of those?
Both hoodies are XXL and both are available in S, XL, and XXL.
No problem, that item is in your cart.
There is another brown hoodie on the rack in addition to the brown and the blue hoodies on the left.
Of course, that's been placed in your shopping cart.
I can help with that. Do you like the blue pants in the back left corner?
I'm sorry, I don't have any expensive plain pants with good customer ratings.
Which ones?
The brown hoodie costs $144.99 and is made by 212 Local. The blue one is $129.99 and is made by Global Voyager.

Can you clarify which jackets you are referring to?
The jacket on the left is 5.0 and the grey jacket is 3.6.
Ok, I found this black coat in the back just to the left of center.
I'm afraid I don't have anything to fit your criteria. What else can I help with?

Sure. Both jackets are from HairDo and are available in size XS only.
I'm sorry, I can't find anything that matches all your criteria.
Let's start with this violet one right in front? Isn't this color just fabulous?
Can I interest you in either the grey pair or the blue pair in the back above the red shoes?
Unfortunately, there are no more highly rated trousers to see at this time.
I will take care of that for you right away!
I'm sorry, could you specify more precisely which pants you are interested in?

The only other pair similar in color to those two is the gray pair on the left.
I have one hoodie to suggest, in green. You can see it  hanging first in the second compartment of the further cupboard on the left.

I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?
I'm sorry, I don't have any pants in twin colors, an affordable price, and good ratings.
